Instructions for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Development of TUF occurs on the "develop" branch of this repository.

Contributions can be made by submitting GitHub pull requests.  Submitted code
should follow our `code style guidelines
<https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines>`_, which provide
examples of what to do (or not to do) when writing Python code.

Contributors must also indicate acceptance of the `Developer Certificate of
Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>`_  (DCO) when making a contribution
to the project.  Acceptance of the DCO can be established by appending a
``Signed-off-by: Your Name <example@domain.com>`` to the Git commit message.
For example:

::

    Commit message

    Signed-off-by: Vladimir Diaz <vladimir.v.diaz@gmail.com>

The required ``Signed-off-by`` text can be automatically appended to the commit
message via the ``-s`` command-line option to ``git commit``:

::

  $ git commit -s -m "Commit message"

The full text of the DCO:

    the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
    whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who

To facilitate development and installation of edited version of the code base,
developers are encouraged to install `Virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_,
which is a tool to create isolated Python environments.  It includes
``pip`` and ``setuptools``, Python packages that can be used to
install TUF and its dependencies. All installation methods of
virtualenv are outlined in the `installation
section <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_,
and instructions for installing locally from source are provided here:
::

    $ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-15.0.3.tar.gz
    $ tar xvfz virtualenv-15.0.3.tar.gz
    $ cd virtualenv-15.0.3
    $ python virtualenv.py myVE


Development Installation
========================

To work on the TUF project, it's best to perform a development install.

1. First, `install non-Python dependencies <INSTALLATION.rst#non-python-dependencies>`_.

2. Then clone this repository:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf

3. Then perform a full, editable/development install.  This will include all
   optional cryptographic support, the testing/linting dependencies, etc.
   With a development installation, modifications to the code in the current
   directory will affect the installed version of TUF.
::

    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


Testing
=======

The Update Framework's unit tests can be executed by invoking
`tox <https://testrun.org/tox/>`_. All supported Python versions are
tested, but must already be installed locally.
::

    $ tox
